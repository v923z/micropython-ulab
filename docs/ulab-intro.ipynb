    "\n",
    "`ulab` is a `numpy`-like module for `micropython` and its derivatives, meant to simplify and speed up common mathematical operations on arrays. `ulab` implements a small subset of `numpy` and `scipy`, as well as a number of functions manipulating byte arrays. The functions were chosen such that they might be useful in the context of a microcontroller. However, the project is a living one, and suggestions for new features are always welcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document discusses how you can use the library, starting from building your own firmware, through questions like what affects the firmware size, what are the trade-offs, and what are the most important differences to `numpy` and `scipy`, respectively. The document is organised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter after this one helps you with firmware customisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third chapter gives a very concise summary of the `ulab` functions and array methods. This chapter can be used as a quick reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapters after that are an in-depth review of most functions. Here you can find usage examples, benchmarks, as well as a thorough discussion of such concepts as broadcasting, and views versus copies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final chapter of this book can be regarded as the programming manual. The inner working of `ulab` is dissected here, and you will also find hints as to how to implement your own `numpy`-compatible functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the first question that one has to answer is, why on Earth one would need a fast math library on a microcontroller. After all, it is not expected that heavy number crunching is going to take place on bare metal. It is not meant to. On a PC, the main reason for writing fast code is the sheer amount of data that one wants to process. On a microcontroller, the data volume is probably small, but it might lead to catastrophic system failure, if these data are not processed in time, because the microcontroller is supposed to interact with the outside world in a timely fashion. In fact, this latter objective was the initiator of this project: I needed the Fourier transform of a signal coming from the ADC of the `pyboard`, and all available options were simply too slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to speed, another issue that one has to keep in mind when working with embedded systems is the amount of available RAM: I believe, everything here could be implemented in pure `python` with relatively little effort (in fact, there are a couple of `python`-only implementations of `numpy` functions out there), but the price we would have to pay for that is not only speed, but RAM, too. `python` code, if is not frozen, and compiled into the firmware, has to be compiled at runtime, which is not exactly a cheap process. On top of that, if numbers are stored in a list or tuple, which would be the high-level container, then they occupy 8 bytes, no matter, whether they are all smaller than 100, or larger than one hundred million. This is obviously a waste of resources in an environment, where resources are scarce. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a reason for using `micropython` in the first place. Namely, that a microcontroller can be programmed in a very elegant, and *pythonic* way. But if it is so, why should we not extend this idea to other tasks and concepts that might come up in this context? If there was no other reason than this *elegance*, I would find that convincing enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above-mentioned considerations, all functions in `ulab` are implemented in a way that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. conforms to `numpy` as much as possible\n",
    "2. is so frugal with RAM as possible,\n",
    "3. and yet, fast. Much faster than pure python. Think of speed-ups of 30-50!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main points of `ulab` are \n",
    "\n",
    "- compact, iterable and slicable containers of numerical data in one to four dimensions. These containers support all the relevant unary and binary operators (e.g., `len`, ==, +, *, etc.)\n",
    "- vectorised computations on `micropython` iterables and numerical arrays (in `numpy`-speak, universal functions)\n",
    "- computing statistical properties (mean, standard deviation etc.) on arrays\n",
    "- basic linear algebra routines (matrix inversion, multiplication, reshaping, transposition, determinant, and eigenvalues, Cholesky decomposition and so on)\n",
    "- polynomial fits to numerical data, and evaluation of polynomials\n",
    "- fast Fourier transforms\n",
    "- filtering of data (convolution and second-order filters)\n",
    "- function minimisation, fitting, and numerical approximation routines\n",
    "- interfacing between numerical data and peripheral hardware devices\n",
    "\n",
    "`ulab` implements close to a hundred functions and array methods. At the time of writing this manual (for version 4.0.0), the library adds approximately 120 kB of extra compiled code to the `micropython` (pyboard.v.1.17) firmware. However, if you are tight with flash space, you can easily shave tens of kB off the firmware. In fact, if only a small sub-set of functions are needed, you can get away with less than 10 kB of flash space. See the section on [customising ulab](#Customising-the-firmware).\n",

    "\n",
    "The MIT licence applies to all material. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Friendly request\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `ulab`, and bump into a bug, or think that a particular function is missing, or its behaviour does not conform to `numpy`, please, raise a [ulab issue](#https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues) on github, so that the community can profit from your experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, if you find the project to be useful, and think that it could be made better, faster, tighter, and shinier, please, consider contributing, and issue a pull request with the implementation of your improvements and new features. `ulab` can only become successful, if it offers what the community needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These last comments apply to the documentation, too. If, in your opinion, the documentation is obscure, misleading, or not detailed enough, please, let us know, so that *we* can fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between micropython-ulab and circuitpython-ulab\n",
    "\n",
    "`ulab` has originally been developed for `micropython`, but has since been integrated into a number of its flavours. Most of these are simply forks of `micropython` itself, with some additional functionality. One of the notable exceptions is `circuitpython`, which has slightly diverged at the core level, and this has some minor consequences. Some of these concern the C implementation details only, which all have been sorted out with the generous and enthusiastic support of Jeff Epler from [Adafruit Industries](http://www.adafruit.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, a couple of instances, where the two environments differ at the python level in how the class properties can be accessed. We will point out the differences and possible workarounds at the relevant places in this document."
